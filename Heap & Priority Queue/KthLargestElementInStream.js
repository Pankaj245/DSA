// Today, I tackled LeetCode 703: Kth Largest Element in a Stream â€“ a problem focused on maintaining the Kth largest element efficiently as new elements are added to a dynamic data stream.

// âœ¨ Problem Summary:
// Given a stream of numbers, the task was to implement a class that can efficiently return the Kth largest element at any point. This involves handling dynamic updates without having to sort the entire dataset every time.

// ðŸ›  Approach & Key Takeaways:
// ðŸ”¹ Utilized a Min Heap (Priority Queue) to track the top K elements.
// ðŸ”¹ Maintained heap size equal to K, ensuring the smallest element in the heap is always the Kth largest in the stream.
// ðŸ”¹ Implemented add() method to insert new elements while keeping the heap size consistent.
// ðŸ”¹ Time Complexity: O(log K) per insertion, making it efficient for large streams.

// ðŸ’¡ Learning Highlights:
// ðŸ”¹ Efficient data structures like heaps make streaming problems manageable.
// ðŸ”¹ Always focus on reducing unnecessary computations; in this case, sorting the entire array on every insertion is avoided.
// ðŸ”¹ Reinforced understanding of object-oriented programming in JavaScript, especially how to design classes with dynamic behavior.

// ðŸ“ˆ Reflection:
// Dynamic stream problems are common in real-time applications like leaderboards, analytics, and recommendation systems. Practicing these strengthens both algorithmic thinking and practical implementation skills.
