// Continuing my Backtracking journey, today I solved LeetCode 77: Combinations â€” a problem that highlights the power of recursion in systematically exploring all possible outcomes.

// âœ¨ Problem Summary:
// Given two integers n and k, the task is to return all possible combinations of k numbers out of the range [1...n].
// For example, if n = 4 and k = 2, the output should include:
// [[1,2], [1,3], [1,4], [2,3], [2,4], [3,4]]

// ğŸ§© Approach: Backtracking
// ğŸ”¹ Used a recursive backtrack function that gradually builds combinations by exploring each possible number from a starting point.
// ğŸ”¹ Whenever the temporary path reaches a length of k, it represents a valid combination and is added to the result.
// ğŸ”¹ After exploring a path, we backtrack by removing the last element â€” allowing the algorithm to explore the next possibility.

// ğŸ“Š Complexity Analysis:
// Time: O(C(n, k)) â†’ proportional to the number of valid combinations.
// Space: O(k) â†’ recursion depth and path storage.

// ğŸ’¡ Learning Highlights:
// ğŸ”¹ This problem reinforced how backtracking provides structure to recursive exploration â€” avoiding unnecessary computation while covering all valid outcomes.
// ğŸ”¹ The key is understanding how to increment the start pointer and undo decisions efficiently.
// ğŸ”¹ A great example of applying recursion with precise boundaries and clear stopping conditions.

// ğŸ“ˆ Reflection:
// Problems like this make backtracking feel like controlled exploration â€” every recursive step narrows down the search space while ensuring nothing is missed. Itâ€™s a perfect mix of logic and structure.
